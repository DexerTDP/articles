_When the headline is all that's needed to create a tick_

I personally didn't understand the whole dynamic in how people perceived news or digested content. Whether from a video, article or a post. That all changed on January 6, 2025 when my interview with Soft White Underbelly dropped on youtube. The backlash comments that it generated which overwhelmed me. People speaking for the irrelevant things while ignoring the overall message, verbal or nonverbal alike. And while I personally learned alot from that. However what would happen next really allowed me to see further that this is a common occurrence. Now and before. 

The first screwed up disaster of 2025 The Los Angeles Fires.  

_"Fires across the Los Angeles area have killed at least 27 people, destroyed more than 14,000 structures and  
charred some 60 square miles..."_
-Sundby, A., & Lynch Baldwin, S. (2025, January 20). L.A. Fires Live Updates: Southern California braces for 
high winds and heightened wildfire risk. CBS News. 

The fires through my recollection would start to happen around late afternoon of Jan 6 as reported by local news 
and it exponentially gained more fire and land around Jan 7 - Jan 8. Twitter/X would post of what would become  
known Apocalyptic LA given the Red Sun due to the fire and ash that surrounded it. But what fascinated me were the 
twitter posts covering the fires with all sorts of shit happening. 

1. From Gavin Newsom is a shit governor and failed los angeles and california 
2. To Karen Bass, the current mayor of LA being recalled for her failure to act immediately  
3. Negelience spending 
4. Water Hydrants not having water 

Meanwhile the local news was explaining in detail why the water wasn't sufficient and given breakdown by breakdown  
accounts of what was happening in the fires as soon as it happened. Now one can make the argument of all news is  
propaganda. If you watched the 1976 movie 'Network', one can learn straight away from the message of the movie. 
Which can be illustrated by an underrated quote in the movie which isn't highlighted enough.  

_"TV is show biz, Max. And, even the News has to have a little showmanship..."_ 

Lets go beyond that, that movie was loosely inspired by a real life case of Christine Chubback, the first person to commit suicide on a live broadcast in 1974; due to personal issues and discontent in her workplace for preferring more  sensational journalism over real journalism. Fun fact, that Footage is still very sought after by the lost media community that it is said that only the audio came out of it. 
Rumors to this day persist that the footage itself was destroyed.  

**Media's deception equals the anti-propaganda generation**

Growing up in post 9/11, 1st gen anons in the media, cyberbullying reports, gang violence and activism taught 
me a bit of how news coverage worked. In fact around 2016-2017 I found an old prime time episode from 1997 for which  
Diane Sawyer aired a segment called "Girlz in Da Hood" which another reporter did. 

In the segment it was depicting the lives of 2 women. One who despite being in the gang ranks tried to live 
a life of a common citizen who worked in a law firm as a secretary while the other was just in the ranks but with no 
prospects at all and was pregnant at the time with her boyfriend. The reporter made it seem that those two were a 
block away from each other when in reality. one was in East LA and the other was located in my old block in Pico-Union.
I could tell right away because of the landmark of barricades that were and still continue to exist.  

I laughed and was shocked by that small detail because anybody who could've seen the coverage then would've believed 
in the media's depiction of the story. In many ways, in looking at that story, I turned anti-prograndist for a little  
bit and it's understandable why. With all the movements that happened from 2006 - 2012, it shaped a generation  
of distrusting the very institutions due to playing on some agenda. However, that brought another problem. 

**In the generation full of skeptics, they are the easiest to be gaslit.**

_"The email scandal, which now includes a trove of campaign chairman John Podesta’s emails stolen from his  
personal account and now being released by WikiLeaks, has continually dogged her campaign but was given new life when 
FBI Director James Comey told Congress the bureau would be reviewing additional emails related to an investigation  
believed already closed."_ 
-McCaskill, Nolan D. “16 of the Most Revelatory Clinton Emails.” POLITICO, 6 Nov. 2016

In 2016, the culmination of the rise of the independent media concluded with all the controversy of Clinton emails.Which were previously posted by wikileaks; who by that point had been a thorn on the US 
government side since 2010 with the documents they published provided to them by Chelsea Manning. Which in turn brought them huge praise by worldwide activists, anonymous, and freethinkers.  

However as time went on with all the protests/riots, mass shootings, Snowden leaks and the overall satisfaction the people had with the governing class. There were some who turned to the internet to look for 
what was the truth of it all. Some found refuge in other places where there was common ideology. So by the time 2016 came of ahead and the Clinton/Podesta emails dropped, the reaction it generated should have not been that much of a shock. People just ignored the warning signs. More so, people wanted someone who was not from the political class to say what many thought 

Enter Trump.  

Now forgetting the fact that he's still from the rich class given his businesses. But he was never born within the political class and unlike most of them, Trump is as sensational as he is but he has his thumb on what was occuring.  However, during his presidency and then afterwards which include the storming of the capital, for which at the time I'm typing this, Trump has pardoned the rioters. The disconnect of the 2 sides of america plus the everlasting doom scrolling popularized by Tiktok. People now treat the news as if it were another sensational tabloid headline as it if we were back in the 1980s/1990s. Only focusing on one sentence or title and then building expectations of what it will be based on. Where clickbait has become normal practice. 

It begs the question who is even telling the truth anymore? 

I always held the belief to absorb the information fully and then mentally pick it apart. Because after all it's said and the following phrase is still true till the end of time. 

_**All sides can be saying their truth but the actual truth is somewhere in the middle.**_

That said, RIP Michael Hastings.
