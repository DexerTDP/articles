# Payload 
_In this instance, payload has a double meaning like money shot._

What do you hear now a days on twitter/x other than the slapfight? The constant stories of victims who were groomed and exploited in some way shape or form. Or
if you go down the rabbit hole. You see victims going against their aggressors and become ruthless. But then you see the other side of the token with those who
do sex work and promoting their fansonly content; while also saying to others who post their content without their consent that those people will be put in legal
action. 

Kind of weird that I'm mentioning that right?

Thing is, both have one common demoninator. 

Both trades deal with the human element being their bodies and in both tech affected their lives in ways that still is less understandable.

Back in 2014, one of the most embrassing yet most targeted events that mergered this concept was the 2014 ICloud leak which affected alot of hollywood women which
it became known as 'The Great Fappening"

_"A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to stealing hundreds of nude photos from celebrities in a massive hack that targeted Jennifer Lawrence, Lea Michele, and Kirsten Dunst.
Under a deal reached with prosecutors, Ryan Collins, 36, pleaded guilty to one felony for unauthorized access of a protected computer. Prosecutors say Collins, of 
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, used a phishing scheme between 2012 and 2014 that involved sending emails requesting username and password information from his targets. 
The emails were designed to look like they were from Apple and Google and came from addresses including "noreply_helpdesk0118@outlook.com" and 
"secure.helpdesk0019@gmail.com," according to court documents."_ - II, Jim Dalrymple. “Man Pleads Guilty in Massive “Fappening” Celeb Nude Hack.” BuzzFeed News,

I remember when that news first broke, hell I even remember when the leaks were first posted to 4chan /b/. My only reaction was 'wow' and im sure others had a
field day and started to save as much content as possible. While the women in the fame world did their own public statements and all that shit. Now the concept 
of your pictures being out there that were meant for private eyes was already out in the unforunate cases such as amanda todd and tyler clementi. This was the 
first attack of its kind that targeted people who by all intends and purposes, were considered "the untouchable ones" beyond just hacking a twitter account. 

Now I faintly remember that the leaks were thrown in batches. In total I think there was about 3 batches of leaks. One of those pictures of the set almost
ended up on a tabloid comment section. I looked at the link of the files and it had people that at the time they were not high profile celebrites. But, just actresses
that were just trying to make it. So I ended up doing a good deed of the day then. Reporting the comment to go down with the people in charge of the site. 

I'm glad they took my report seriously but then again when they read the section "either do it or else" they kind of had to oblige. 

Overall it was this incident that allowed me to realize the scope of how something very mudane or insignificant as pictures that were meant to be for either you
or your partner can go haywire fast. 

But this is however one aspect of how tech and nudes intersect. And wildly the second time I intercepted with this concept it was filled in innuendo 

<ins>_4 years later - Circulation_</ins>

By this point, I had already retired from hacking but I was restless, working a very low paying sales job which then transition to e-commerce role. I was already 
burned out so I decided to then started to look for work with what I got my degree on, which was graphic design. So I applied as normal until I came across an ad
that was for web developer role and already, I knew what it meant as one of the qualifiers for the job was. 

_Be comfortable with adult nudity_
 
Turns out it was a webcam company which was located near los angeles was hiring. Now I could've just said nah and kept it going. But then I realized that its a 
damn job and worst it could happen is not get hired by the company. So I applied and I was invited to an interview. The building was located in the downtown area 
in the most unassuming condo you can think of. But as expect, that condo had its sercurity measures for its tenants. So I had to go through the check in process 
of theirs. 

Then I went up the floor and knocked on the door. I was let in and it was something. 

What I can remember faintly was a white board of the girls name with a check list of tasks. Off the side corner a large desk with people working on the computer, 
on the other corner there was a photodrop where the photographer was taking pictures of camgirls. Then in the far end, lord knows what was happening back there. 

So the manager of the outfit interviewed me and asked me the typical questions. I can't remember exactly what the questions were but they were interested as to 
why I was applying for the role. For which I explained my circumstances then. And while I didn't get the job but I understood the keywords they were using to 
get new prospects to work for them. 

I also decided to snoop around their site and its code. They had the basics down and while I didn't go further because in my mind I was still in trying to make
regular life work. However, that isn't to say that I didn't explore that world and what it was like. 

And in doing so, I learned how some the material they put up would be in some telegram and whatsapp chats apart from the traditional porn sites and while I 
didn't know it then. This phenomena is called image-based abuse, a practice that became quite a regular after the covid lockdown.

_"One of the most common methods is to subscribe to a model's paid page just long enough to download the videos, and then share them on websites that are completely
free to access. There are hundreds of such sites, including French ones like VeryLeak's and Leakimedia. Some even offer a semi-professional organization, offering 
a real catalog with hundreds of pages, each devoted to an actress and very rarely to an actor. Unsurprisingly, these performers do not receive a cent from this 
unauthorized distribution."_ -Defer, Aurélien, and Florian Reynaud. “Piracy Evolves to Target Porn Actresses, Left Powerless by Leaks.” Le Monde.fr, Le Monde,

"Why pay for this content when you can get it for free?" is their thought and like anything, its competition on who can get more. 

The thing about these leak campaigns that have grown worse over the years is that is a method that has grown to not just be only targetting those in sex workers
but also those who were groomed and extorted as well. Discord servers and telegram chats that are dedicated to these leaks are a dime a dozen. 

Sex workers and other people have tried to fight back which include civil suits and/or DCMA takedowns. And while in the time of writing this article there still
isn't a federal law that attacks this problem but others have tried to put awareness to this issue. 

And despite this, years later, I would have an encounter with this topic yet again but in a different way. 

<ins>_Enter 2023 - Tracing Vulnerbity with a twist_</ins>

At this point I was looking for work after ending a freelance contract. By this point, I had made my brief living taking small gigs whether being photo editing or
taking pictures of models for e-commerce clothing companies. I was searching for work when I saw an ad of executive assistant. At that time I was kind of looking
for some rountine in my life as freelancing can be very volitale. So I send my resume in and I got the interview which was via zoom. 

Then the day of the interview came and after talking to the woman I learned who I was going to work for. 

An fansonly model. 

What a world huh? 

She did ask me about my resume and portfolio of my work which extended to design campaigns (web/graphic). In that interview she opened up to me in what she was 
looking for and what the work entail. I'll put it as this, it was the first time I realized how some women in the platform earned through their trade. The work consisted 
in talking to men in chats as if I were the model and manage her web presence. It was then when I understood that in the world were women's sexuality was going to be shamed or 
gawk at, might as well monitize the bitch. 

But as I mentioned before, they still deal with the image based abuse problem but unforunately there's another layer they haven't considered yet.

<ins>_Enter: AI - The gift and Curse</ins>

From openai's inception of chatgpt and other services that followed, ai has increasingly been implemented to become a part of human life and existence with intergations 
like twitter with grok, google with gemini, etc. Some have took their tech and tried to do their own spin to things. When some in 4chan created an ai that put clothes back
on women who in the original pictures were nude.

_"DignifAI has emerged on 4chan, the messaging board aimed at insecure young men with no healthy outlets. This “movement” (as it’s being called) is the use of AI imaging 
platforms to add clothing back onto women who viewers deem unholy."_- Hayward, Jeff. “People Are Digitally Adding More Clothing onto Women’s Photos Using AI.” Medium, 
Ai-Ai-OH, 12 Feb. 2024, medium.com/ai-ai-oh/people-are-digitally-adding-more-clothing-onto-womens-photos-using-ai-374857a68e1a. Accessed 25 Oct. 2025.

When I saw users use this to troll of workers, it was tad funny in my book. And frankly an innovative way to use ai. However with good, came the bad. 

One of the bad is and in some instances where women who work in the entertainment business, ai is often used by others in all sorts of ways to changing form. And in others 
to way worse is using ai to create any photo be a nude and then distrubute it around aka deepfake revenge porn

What follows next is a snippet of a conversation where a woman reached out to me about this topic as she wanted to learn on how it happens after an acquientence of hers suffered this attack.

- her: I would like to learn what to do if that happens to me.
- me: like sick fucks using ai for their material?
- her: Yes
- me: *posted a site that specialize ai deepfake porn site after research* That didn’t take long for me to find
- her: Ewewww
- me: I could run an experiment with a photo but then that’s grey area there, legal and all that.
- her: Hang on *she provided a full clothed picture* Fire away, My head is not it.
- me: *use the picture on the service* It did a nude alright.
- her: Jesus, I don't need to see. Was it something believable?
- me: Not a good one due to the blur affect but it’s there
- her: Uuuugh

There's services that allow a free sample that you can use, the quality may not be good until you pay for said service. 
That said, the pay is not that expensive. The service I use, you just pay no less than $6 to produce a deepfake nude for you.

It begs the question of the new techonology in how far can it be taken from your voice, your image and anything else in between. 
How can one protect themselves from it all.

Andy warhol warned that everybody would get their 15 seconds of fame. Now a days, people strive to have even 15 mins of anonimity. 
If it means you can still keep a sense of yourself.
