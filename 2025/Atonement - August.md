# Atonement
_A past of mixed emotions only to later finding peace with a decentralized movement._

_"The whole idea was that there was no identity. Anyone could “take up arms” for a cause under the banner. So, it’s hard to trace the “Anonymous” 
lineage. But essentially, the original groups that flew under that banner were truly talented and got shit done. But they all ended up getting 
cocky, bragging, and/or slipping up. Eventually all the big fish were busted. Over time, less and less talented hackers flew under the banner.
And on the inverse more and more less than capable people started posing under that ideology… for clout, ego, etc. There hasn’t really been 
anything left of it for a very long time now."_ -Inside-Dingo4913, Reddit User, 01/27/2025.

That quote is what most of the general consensus of what people think of anonymous these days. And to give credit to that user that was the nicest 
thing I heard apart from the usual "meh the real ones are gone, the rest are either larps or skids." or some with more slurs involved. I remember 
getting some of those comments myself equivalating me to a "low level hacker" and a "mickey mouse hacker" which the low level I'll take it because 
I never fancied myself to being the best shit out there. But mickey mouse hacker that's a lil off. 

Regardless, some if not most people will only remember the golden age of anonymous or the 1st gen as I call them. Names like Commander X, Topihary , Kayla, 
Ghost Exodus, Barret Brown, Jeremy Hammond, Gregg Housh, etc and yes even the ex-communicated of the movement, Sabu where among the publicly 
recognized of the group and its those names people often remember by from 2007-2011. However there are exceptions like Deric Lostutter who as 
KnightSec/KYAnonymous was responsible for the Steubenville case to gain mass international recognition to talk about a case of sexual violence 
and corruption. 

However, away from the public consciousness, anonymous still thrived venturing into other operations, while some operations where American based 
but many other ops were from other countries. One thing is clear, many who carried the banter learned from either the 1st generation of anons and laid low. 
Others simply as cliche as this is going to sound, grew up. And a minority, ventured into some other branch of the hacker community. 

As per me? I orbited anonymous for years; decade to be exact, on and off. To then, becoming a "member" under one of the old sec crews within the movement for 
its time. However, with the same speed of joining, I also stepped down. 

<ins>Full Circle: From Orbiter to Insider</ins>

I think when I first realized I was sort of being taken more as an orbiter of the movement was around the beginning of 2020. My group and I started
to venture more to posting a lot of security and digital privacy. We also had started our blog which was named under one out of the 2 RAT tools we 
used called Netwire. Tongue n Cheek? Sure. But it was a nod to our past. We collaborated a lot in the writings in terms of our shared experiences 
and what we did as well as talk about cases of how digital would influence the outcome, if it existed then. 

Twitter then was very different to what it is now but the anon cause in full swing. I with my group carried on with our goals in trying to legit 
ourselves in infosec. Until one day we saw that there would be a stream that commander x would do on twitch to talk about new way of 
communication by using the opensim software to go on OsGrid. OsGrid is sort of the open source of Second Life. My group decided that it was I who would show 
up to rep the group in that stream. By that point, we had spoken to x briefly in comments of his tweets but we didn't think much of it as it was just cordial 
talks. When I first went on that stream and I showed up with an avatar, I remember X said

_"Ha yes he's here the federation is here."_

I'm like well, that was as animated as anyone was in seeing my group or myself. I remember that stream very lightly of all details. However, I do 
remember at one point in the stream Commander X said that "The Federation are also friends of anonymous"

Then almost overnight, people started to follow the account in doves. What elevated our profile more was what would happen weeks after that with the
death of George Floyd. And while my group came back briefly in a humantarian capacity to help protestors with first aid and put footage at mass for 
people to see on twitter (#HROP - Humanatarian and Reporting OP). On off breaks then, I would be venturing in OSgrid. I won't forget what Commander X told me 
in a conversation I had with him then in OSgrid. It was words to the effect of 

_"Its surprising what anonymous is now, like there's a shift. Not many of the new anons listen to the wisdom I and others try to preach out there. 
Surprisingly my support now comes from places where I never expected.."_

Had I understood the weight of those words then. I probably would've re-thought things. However a month later I was invited by GHC_Sec to join them,
a hacking crew under the anonymous banner. My own group went back to the shadows quietly and I joined the sec and therefore anonymous in a 
non-hacking capacity, as I was distancing myself from my past more after hacker retirement. That was my condition before joining, they were cool 
about it and I went to work, the op I started with my group, it just carried with me alone, away from the screen.

However, on the screen, I started to notice a few things. 

<ins>1st Flag - a life ended </ins>

Probably the first warning I had was when I heard the story of Vanessa Guillen

_"Authorities are searching for a missing soldier stationed at Fort Hood who hasn’t been seen since Wednesday. Vanessa Guillen, 20, was last seen in
the parking lot of her barracks at the Fort Hood Army post in Texas on April 22 around 1 p.m., according to a news release from the United States 
Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID). A $15,000 reward for information leading to Guillen’s whereabouts is being offered by CID, a tweet from 
Fort Hood said Monday. Keys to her car and room were found in the armory where she was working earlier in the day along with her identification 
card and wallet, the release said."_ -Artemis Moshtaghian, and Hollie Silverman. “US Army Offers $15,000 Reward for Information Leading to the 
Whereabouts of a Missing Fort Hood Soldier.” CNN, April 27, 2020. https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/27/us/missing-fort-hood-soldier-vanessa-guillen.

That case moved me because to me, it was unheard of. As I heard of the details and the army branch doing very little to protect vanessa. Then I 
would read past cases of soldiers in fort hood committing suicide in numbers that were not normal.  It was a case that I felt strongly that I, the 
sec members and others can jump on board. Because its about the system treatment of not only people who serve in the military but also minorities 
serving. 

So I brought it up to the sec and they were with me 100% and we tried what we could to raise awareness. Not necessarily hack because I thought this
was more activism than it was hacktivism. The sec members sort of agreed. My idea was push every other avenue we had in our disposal (which was not 
much) to create a buzz that lead in protests that would've united people.

Boy I was wrong. 

While yes all of us of the core group tried to bring awareness. Other than the latino community groups and boards I posted my twitter links to when 
talking about the case. Nobody else outside of that really was interested in it. Much were still dedicated to other ops. There was a part of me 
that was disappointed. But I also excused it as "oh other anons are just busy" 

And by then, after everyone else in the sec saw the lack of response. We decided to let it go and move on to support other ops in the movement. 

<ins>2nd flag - Dynamic Shift</ins>

There was a point that when I was doing my ops whether helping in first aid in protests or other works, I began to see a shift that was at times a lil cringe. 

In particular with tiktok with the new generation finding of anonymous through the video that circulated then. Which invigorated everyone within 
the movement. But it also brought some cringe. One particular instance is when I saw vids of some dudes wearing guy fawks mask to dance as if it 
were a tease dance. Some videos straight up sexualized anons to hell. 

I couldn't help to laugh at it but man I cringed so hard because bro what the fuck?  

A new wave of users coming in to the movement and having virtually no idea what anons were fully about. It became very weird to say the least. New 
wave at times were going against other anon accounts when they commented on other anon big accounts for one. Which isn't that farfetched to be 
honest but it was still odd to see. 

Then there came the infighting.

After the protests had passed, it came to where to put attention next? Hence, that's when some of the infighting began. Now commonly within 
communities or large gathering in general, there's always an aspect of in fighting. But in the instances I saw, it was for absolutely petty shit.
Powerleveling, ego fagging and just retarded shit. Normally you would think it would be just a new gen issue but this was happening all across the 
board. Which it didn't sit well with me.

Regardless, I kept minding my business and kept doing for the cause. Because after all, this was a movement and we who are in it try to make the work 
mean something. And in my case, I felt like I was supporting an ideology and in return I got a unity that I never really felt in life. Family if that makes 
sense. 

However, the final straw was left me alienated and mixed emotions were found. 

<ins>Final Straw: Conflicted </ins>

At this point I had started to focus more on opsafewinter given that it was already winter in the US and then, a case came across my view that was 
targeting somebody I cared about. I'm talking a full blown malicious campaign to make their life hell with harassment that extended to their family which included their kids. Given what I was reading, seeing, being told, and then finding out that there were others who were targeted too apart from my friend by the same malicious actors. I was invested. I won't go into 
full detail here of the backstory out of respect to those were affected by the events. 

But what I can say is that the case in my view, fit the bill to fight back aganist what was being done and given the investment aspect I had. 
In some ways, I went back in "half" capacity. The sec members were supportive but wanted a clear sum up of when things got critical to step in.
When that happened, it was decided that for the whole op (as it was shaping to be one) had to be around the clock. Since in the sec, I was the only american in, 
therefore help would be needed. A video was made with all the info ready to be dropped and start a campaign with, gathering other anons to come on board who 
were interested.

What ended up happening? No answer. One or two even said it wasn't an op worth doing. 

When I tell you, I was upset. That's an understatement. 

I was livid in every sense of the word. The illusion of thinking I had support within the movement, gone with it. Now to many of you who maybe reading 
this can think that this sounds some juvenile shit. And to answer that, in some ways I can agree now. But back then, I didn't let anybody tell me shit. Like I 
wasn't asking shit for in defense of me, I was asking for help for another and I was left in the dust with the crew. 

So then the questioning and rage began, "what the fuck was I fighting for when no one is down to do shit?" among other statements

I remember telling everybody in the sec that I was in, that I was done and that if that meant I have to leave the sec then so be it. As far as I was concerned, 
fuck it, i'm out, I'll do the work that needs to be done on my own. I let it go with Vanessa, I was not about to make the same mistake here. 

The sec members were also furious. The sec's founder as well. I guess amongst themselves, they realized that they no longer recognized what they were seeing from
the community at large. That it wasn't about fully the cause anymore as they too started to see the petty infighting and all the other issues plaguing the 
community around that time. 

At that point we were approached then by the localleaks team to see if we worked with them for a while. 

So that one November night, it was decided that all of us within the sec would stepped away from anonymous. The founder of the sec put their own 
tweet out to make the announcement which I'll paraphrase of what I can remember of the tweet. 

"To whom it may concern, As of this moment, I'm going to pull out of the anonymous collective all together with the rest of #ghc_sec and we are 
going to do work as support and investigators for the website localleaks.org"

<ins>After Anonymous</ins>

After I stepped down from anonymous, I began to work on other projects which include the case that caused me to leave. Mainly to cope with the 
anger that I felt given all. It was a gift and a curse. Anger did serve as fuel in every work I did then. But to help me balance, I explored other 
areas within the hacking and other communities as you might as well do it. 

Many things ended up happening but 2 stand out to me, now looking back.

First, I met other unknown former anons outside of the community. One that stood out to me, I will name them DR. DR was in the collective in its 
early phases up towards chanalogy. He worked I believe as a sys admin or close to network systems related. I didn't know he was an anon until he 
disclosed it himself in a discord chatroom.

_"Anonymous went to shit when it went all moral fagging..."_ 

Of course others would agree with DR given that the chatroom was apart of a troll server which supported a podcast that went after online weirdos. 
I would interact very briefly with DR, had a talk with him about the topic. He came across to me as very old school straight shooter. Full troll 
who used the internet for fun.. or his defination of fun. We became somewhat friends after collaborating on one case together.

Secondly, there were some active anons that were close to me that respected my decision to step down. In some instances, because the now defunct 
GHC_Sec and some of its members went to localleaks, some anons were trusting enough to bring me to servers and group chats where info was being 
tossed around left and right. I understood some did that but it felt weird because this as collaborative as I saw more so than when I was apart
of it. I even appeared on the anon podcast Anonymous Bites Back with other anons to talk about world events around July 2021. I didn't say a whole 
hell of alot but when I did, I tried to be sensible in certain topics. 

And for a while I thought that maybe this needed to happen to re-calibrate my mind on what truly meant to be an anon. I almost considered going
back to the mask then.  

Until that is, creative differences started to happened between some of the podcast. In some ways repeating past patterns I saw before. But sensing 
that would get that far, I decided to go quiet. Best decision I made as then later there was a big infight. What happened afterwards was anybody's 
guess. I do know one didn't take it well and needed some time off which I didn't blame them. 

However, once drama hit my doorstep again over some petty shit I'm like nope. If there was any doubts then for me that returning to the movement was a 
definate no, it was that moment.  

So, I shut down entirely and changed my handle for a new chapter. 

As far as I was concerned, I had my own work now going on and didn't need the extra bullshit. It wasn't like a year ago where I had no direction to
go. Now I had a direction which I carved out on my own on where I wanted to go. 

Hence why now, I go by Dexer. 

<ins>Looking Back?</ins>

There is much of a difference now than it was back then. There's some within the movement that still do work and hey, all is good, power to them. 
As for me, when I was anon and at time or two after, I talk to anons that come to me for advice. Which I don't mind, I can offer my experience and 
its up to them if they learn from it. After all movements can only exist if there's people to carry the raw foundation of the past going forward.
 
However, on the personal, I wouldn't return to being an active anon. At this stage, to go back to taking on the mantle actively its equal to 
nostalgia of what could've been. I feel like my time has passed in it. But in what happened then, it lead for me to become the foundation I needed 
to become for which I can hold myself accountable to whether its acknowledging my past or my actions with what I do now.   

That said, stepping down from anonymous is not a bad thing. How I go about it now is I give back in my own way to a movement that did what it 
supposed to do. It took ordinary people and made them to be those with purpose. Its like somebody told me years ago when we talked about anonymous,
ironically enough, now I get what they meant by it. 

_"Anonymous, is like a system protocol with the wetware element being people. But like any system, it will always have bugs. Learn from it and
carry it. That just means the idea did its job."_
