_An era most didn't know existed until a lawsuit ended it._

_"On March 3, 2023, social media giant Meta sued Freenom in a Northern California court, alleging cybersquatting violations and trademark infringement. The lawsuit also seeks information about the identities of 20 different “John Does” — Freenom customers that Meta says have been particularly active in phishing attacks against Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp users."_ -Sued by Meta, Freenom Halts Domain Registrations – Krebs on Security. krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/sued-by-meta-freenom-halts-domain-registrations/

That quote came from an article that I recently read about the fate of freenom which was somewhat sad, and a little unexpected but also at some point, it was going to end. Especially since by that point in 2023, the atmosphere of free domains, or "the free care package" as I call it is a lot more restrained as said compared to the early 2000s when it was rampant. From domains such as .tk and .
co.cc being popularized to all of a sudden domains that not only endured poor reputation in internet security, blacklisted by Google and eventually both ceasing operations. With the understanding of how cybercrime grew came the inevitable decline of such services, which leads to the question...

How will hackers, spammers, scammers,swapers and phishers adapt to change when "free" is no longer an option?

The answer although obvious but the how? that's the question.

<ins>**The Domain Foundation**</ins>

When it comes to the hacker culture, it's understood that its foundation did not start all behind on the computer screen but rather the small blue boxes to not pay extra to call long-distance lines. However, with the introduction of the internet to the public masses around the 1990s, many were in awe and also in wonder at how much the internet could be used to its fullest capabilities; which before was only a privilege of businesses and universities in the 1980s and government entities with DARPA program back in the 50s. That said, domains were no different.

The first domain registrations were around the mid-1980s via the old saying of first come, first serve and believe it or not, free....

_"In 1985, the registration of domain names was free and unrestricted. However, the process was more complicated than it is now, where you can buy a domain basically like you would order anything else online. In 1985, only those with ARPA access could register domains...."_ -Baltes, Lisa. “What Was the First Domain Name Ever Registered? - OnlyDomains Blog.” OnlyDomains Blog, 7 Feb. 2024,

Domain management then was handled by an Non Profit called Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in a centralized manner managed by Jon Postel; where the only thing you did to secure a domain was to contact him and ask for the domain. But like most things around this inital period while domains were restritive but it was also a flawed system due to in its lack of oversight.

And for its time, that procedure worked.

The entities that needed the go ahead and secure their domains through informal procedure did just that. In 1992, Domain name management was handed over to another non-profit organization called InterNIC(Internet Network Information Center), which subcontracted the management of domain names to Network Solutions. It was here where the flaw kicked in when around 1995, instead of following tradition of giving domains for free as its precessor had done, some within the staff of network solutions was charging people to buy domains at $100 a domain.

Thus the first instance of domain abuse for malicious intent and between that and people reselling domains after purchase was being seen.

This later on created the inevitable choice which lead to InterNIC becoming ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) and domain registrations were opened up in a more regulative system, in an attempt to try to regulate the market but also make wave for new country code regristars could be connected to ICANN to be kept track of while not losing automony. Its how in other country code as .
co.uk are regristered both in nominet and icann.

However with one ending of a cycle begins a new cycle.

<ins>**Golden Era**</ins>

With the regulation of regristering for domains were getting the mainstream domains as .com, .org, .net as well as top country top level domains as .
co.uk, .co.jp to name a few. However there was the usher in of new obsecure domains that were buying at a chance to get in the internet gold rush to have their own presence.

By 1997, a territory of new zealand named tokelau were getting their own domain country level domain extension that ended in .tk

A domain that years later would have its gathered infamy or which I like to call

Golden Era

That's right because to me, golden era of free domains and websites wasn't necessarily in the 90s but rather in mid to end of 2000s with the existence of .tk

When I was introduced to phishing all those years ago, the guy who showed me the ropes would use a .tk in the end of that phishing page with the template I made with .htaccess file confirgured . I didn't necessarily ask him how he was hosting his shit then. But later on by pure observation, I ended up realizing he self hosted his myspace phish site he used for school with an apache http server as opposed as you would think by compromising some server or free hosting services. Companies at the time such as x10hosting, 000webhost, byethost, pastehtml, ripway to name a few that I heard of. Then there was also the og sites like geocities and angelfire that were still accessible.

As the guy explained to me "for the heavy duty , its always outside of your space"

Looking back, it made sense. As a teenager going to school, you had accesibility to a petridish of test subjects that you can use to test every little imagination of skill to see what works and what doesn't work. Then whatever works, you would then use for other shit on the low. Like I mentioned in my interview on my infamous interview, I got started in phishing. How? by using ripway along with .ml domain for my own myspace phishing page along with the email I would send via bulk attacks (email spamming).

I can't remember how I structured my domain to be. But man, kids did fell for it back in the day. Unlike the friend who showed me the ropes, I didn't have the luxury to have a seperate computer to host my own sites. Plus I figured it was easy to have some plausible denibity if I was nit in school.

I used .ml domain as the problem with .tk was that it was and remained to being the go to domain for every other sleezy bastard like myself to go and get a domain for free. But eventually, security researchers started to flag .tk domains and it did lead with some setbacks.

However.

With the rise of facebook and twitter in 2008-2009. A new domain took over the popularity of free domains

**.cc**

Established in 1997, this country top level domain from cocos island was also gaining popularity between all the spamers, phishers and every other bastard who needed a free site.

especially under the second level domain .co.cc

The infamy of .co.cc domain was not other than creating spam blogs which in its traditional sense it was a blog created that the author uses to promote sites and inflate their ranks on search engines such as google or to sell ads/links

Given the hype, I decided to expand my domain perference with my own .co.cc domain for a honeypot site but this time using 000webhost service to host said site. Because .co.cc you were able to get some ranking. But unlike .tk or .ml. Just as fast it came to being popular. It also became very unstable.

By the end of 2011, google had dislisted all sites related to .co.cc

and yea, I still miss the honeypot site to this day because it allowed for me to understand how threat actors would approach their work process. Every hacker has their own mindset in how to approach to solve problems. I learned a little bit from them just as I was learning the old tech and its culture.

I also experimented with other free domains such as a redirecting domain provider .co.nr and eventually .tk. By the time I started my own group back in 2013. I had already had my free .tk domain in a hosting service for purely email which we all used to communicate. By this time, I believe freenom was already handling all the free domain regristrations of .tk and .ml along with others I never heard of.

<ins>**The eventual downfall**</ins>

As time went on, I started to experience more setbacks when it cames to establish sites under free domain extentions given their mass use. Now its no secrets that some hosting companies just didn't give a shit since they profitted from the use of a service.

As the saying goes _If its free then you are the product_

However as years went on, domains and hosting packages started to become more accessible and somewhat affordable to get rather than not. Then there is the rise of bulletproof hosting which in my opinion is basically infamy haven with an expiration date. That said, for those who were nostalgic or new fag who was just learning the ropes, freenom still was the go until eventually meta sued them for cybersquatting phishing pages.

Which till this day, I find very ironic that free domains as I once knew it was ended by the very service that .tk promoted back in the day called tweak which was a url shortner where you can rename your facebook page with the .tk name.

<ins>**What now?**</ins>

With freenom being gone the question becomes, are their still free domains or hosting?

Oh for sure. There's still some obsecure free domain services you can still find but is it worth it? Not really.

Buying a domain for $2 saves you the headache to dealing with the setbacks you would get with a blacklisted domain and plus you have flexibity in how to control said domain. And before the question gets asked .tk domains are on sale in some regristars but its no longer free.

As for free hosting, replit was a new service I did use for a bit for some production sites that I needed to test before deciding if I wanted to use it for a potential homelab server that I'm set to get soon. But with replit going to a subscription pay service, there's still other alternatives out there for web app hosting from vercel and github pages, to name a few.

As for what current spammers, hackers and phishers use now? whatever they can get their hands on. Some are careful what they use and some don't give a shit.

For anyone who wants to try to use bulletproof hosting. I wouldn't recommend using one service for too long due to such cases of lolek and labhost. No matter if it was 3 years or 10 years. But if its in the feds radar, its only a matter of time before its seized.

So in all of this why write something like this?

Part of it is nostalgia and reflecting on memories. And on the other, I still remember the comments of my interview, in being called a criminal

As a retired hacker/phisher I will say this, for as much people want to try to downplay phishing. Which in it self thats stupid to do because if we really get down to the nitty gritty of what is phishing, its simply this.

**Phishing = learning the art of deception**
