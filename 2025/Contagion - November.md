# Contagion
_The algroithm that took time to spread an overexaspeated infection._ 

_"Last week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed it has opened investigations into 250 individuals affiliated with 764 and other online networks of predators who befriend minors and other vulnerable people and coerce them to 
create sexually explicit material and commit acts such as harming themselves or animals. The federal agency has investigated the phenomenon since at least 2023 and warned the public about 764, a loose network of people that engage in violent, 
predatory behavior. The FBI reported that all its 55 field offices were investigating 764 and similar networks."_ -“FBI Opens Inquiry into 764, Online Group That Sexually Exploits and Encourages Minors to Self-Harm.” The Guardian, 
The Guardian, 11 May 2025, www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/11/fbi-investigation-764-online-group.

I heard not too long ago that the FBI wants to now use the term nihilistic violent extremists when it comes to cases like that.

_"According to the affidavit in the District of Columbia, 764 is a network of nihilistic violent extremists who engage in criminal conduct in the United States and abroad, seeking to destroy civilized society through the
corruption and exploitation of vulnerable populations, which often include minors. The 764 network’s accelerationist goals include social unrest and the downfall of the current world order, including the United States 
Government."_ -“Member of Violent Extremist Network “764” Charged with Animal Crushing, Sexual Exploitation of a Minor, Cyberstalking and Interstate Threats.” Justice.gov, 27 Oct. 2025,

It screams hope right, that finally the american government wants to now tackle this issue that many would say started with the pandemic when people would speak out on reddit about this phenomeon. 

_"a discord-based group of 15-25 years old edgy wannabees who sexually exploit underage girls and blackmail them after, doxx people, steal discord accounts, brag to everyone they see about how much *censored*
they have in their mega folders and most importantly make cringy edits of pseudo-satanic clips they find on obscure websites, which they then share in their circlejerk telegram groups. may seem creepy and mysterious 
from the outside but the members themselves are hilariously dumb and immature once you get to know them."_ - Pretentiousdiscord, July 10, 2021, Reddit user

However as many have figured out by now, this is a small spec of what makes up The Com. Which the government decided to explain the overview

_"There are currently three known primary subsets within The Com: Hacker Com,3 In Real Life (IRL) Com,4 and Extortion Com.5 Each subset has a distinct focus; however, members of The Com often participate in criminal 
activity encompassed in more than one subset and maintain relationships with members in multiple subsets simultaneously, in case their skills are beneficial. The members within these subgroups typically have a shared 
interest, ideology, or goal and work together, adding others to the group and splintering when necessary, to achieve their mission."_ _“Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) | the Com: Theft, Extortion, and Violence 
Are a Rising Threat to Youth Online.” Ic3.Gov, 23 July 2025, www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250723-3.

From FBI making arrests to people within the internet, hacking groups going out of their way to combat the problem whether the groups to net properties these groups have like the work BX, Vendetta Mafia, and others not named. 
Like I said before, it looks like progress right?

And yet, not many people grasped to how extensive this problem became that it took multiple people outside that enviornment to see what was happening and cause so much coverage that the US government decided to publicly
take action. Most people are under the assumption that its a 5/6 year old problem, caused by the pandemic and boredom.

What if I were to tell you that from my lens, it isn't all foriegn. 

If you were to ask me of what I think of the situation? Its quite frankly cappers that were never caught that found discord and imagined it was what heaven looked like. Thus expansion. Besides the foundation was set in motion
before all this took shape. 

<ins>_*Unknown Concept that took shape*_</ins>

The concept of sextortion was unknown when the amanda todd sucide happened. She wasn't the first girl to be victim of this act but she was the first who spoke out about it on youtube which is still up to this day. Which the media, 
not understanding what it was in its fullest sense decided to be another case of "cyberbullying". The true origin of when this crime started to become a thing? I wouldn't be able to tell you the exact moment. But it could've been 
way earlier than that. You also have to remember myspace was a thing years before. And 2 things led to its downfall. The Megan Myers case as well as stint operations which arrested more pedos than people realized
that were on myspace. 

_"Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said Thursday that police in the state had arrested six convicted sex offenders for violating parole by posting online profiles on MySpace.com. The social networking site provided data on the 
profiles to the attorney general. The arrests are the result of what the state is calling the first crackdown in the country on sex offenders stemming from data that MySpace provided to several state attorneys general in May."_

These issues plus much more contributed to myspace's downfall and allowed other social media companies like facebook, youtube and twitter rise, then instagram, strigram, younow, blogtv and much more. Until later on, the issues that plagued
myspace started to affect other sites as many grew and grew and grew. Amanda was just one casuality out of the many and nothing changed. To put in prespective, facebook with all the infrastrcutre it has, it had this issue when the new mexico
district attorney decided to go at them for their neglience in a very reoccuring problem. which just leads to one aspect of the problem being set.

_"Last December, Attorney General Torrez filed a lawsuit against Meta for allegedly failing to protect children from sexual abuse, online solicitation, and human trafficking. The suit also argues that the flawed design of Instagram and Facebook 
led to the recommendation of child sexual abuse material and child predator accounts to minor users. The suit references a substantial amount of internal material from Meta, such as a 2021 internal Meta presentation that estimated 100,000 children
per day received online sexual harassment, including pictures of adult genitalia, via its platforms."_ - Hendrix, Justin. “New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez on His Lawsuit against Meta.” Tech Policy Press, 11 Aug. 2024,

<ins>_*New Methods = New problems*_</ins>

So 1/3 of the foundational problem has been laid bare, what about the other parts?

_"Today we're announcing the initial roll out of YouTube Live, which will integrate live streaming capabilities and discovery tools directly into the YouTube platform for the first time. This begins with a new YouTube Live browse page 
(www.youtube.com/live), where you can always find the most compelling live events happening on YouTube and add events to your calendar. Subscribe to your favorite YouTube live-streaming partners to be notified of upcoming live streams on your 
customized homepage.  Today, we'll also start gradually rolling out our live streaming beta platform, which will allow certain YouTube partners with accounts in good standing to stream live content on YouTube. The goal is to provide thousands 
of partners with the capability to live stream from their channels in the months ahead."_ - Siegel, Joshua. “YouTube Is Going LIVE.” Blog.youtube, YouTube Official Blog, 8 Apr. 2011, blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-is-going-live.

Remember the eariler quote of the subsets of the com. Some of them do dabble in swatting. Not just on streamers but also others that had nothing to do with the camera lights. The root? Many can say it started within the gaming groups, xbox and all
that shit.

But of course like anything it evolved. And with evolving came new ways to get away with such actions. 

The way swatting would work is as it sounds like. You would call using a VOIP number (Voice Over Internet Protocol) number that is given to you by some service. And with a few keywords you would say to the phone operator that you will do such horrible
action and then hang up. Depnding how serverity of it. They may send at best 2 cops to your house, at worst the damn swat team. Streamers, to gamers and eventually harassment victims and such would end up knowing the experience. 

My introduction to this aspect of it was when I left anonymous and decided to work on my friend's case. One in particular truly knew how to rattle people with that practice (or at least tried too). It was because of that target that I encountered this 
weird chain of people who were doing this aspect of it. Almost all for petty reasons, even one who swatted a woman for not providing pictures (yes, you read that right). Through me going around that part I encountered names and reported that now a days
others are going after for their affliations with NVE folks. I tend to refrain to give names because the thing is, they like seeing their names put in pieces. More the better for them. Plus for all I know, police can be looking into them too.

So the question comes, what about the 3rd foundational problem? sextortion, swatting and what else you may ask? Trauma Economy

Trauma Economy? Well yea because all this at the end of the day is currency. Social currency, Money, whatever. Why do you think gore videos that are put out there whether is cartel beheadings, and all the shock value that makes the human mind be 
numb to all violent content these people strive to have to then trade?

You combine all this and you get the whole phenomena of "nihilistic violent extremist".

<ins>_*The Perfect Storm*_ </ins>

So all of that arrives to today. This overexasperated problem that many have yet to grasp. Hell not to long ago, I saw comments that were shocked to know that crushing was a thing. I'm not sure if this a good thing or a bad thing. 

What I do know is, this plainfield of shit is like the darkside of decentralized movements. Except here, its decentralized networks. 

In gang culture standards you can see this pattern repeat the same thing, where they are under the umbrella of a gang but not one group is fully the same than the other.

Which bring to the question of what the journalist Joe Tidy asks in his book ctrl+alt+chaos 

_*How can we stop the cycle of teenage boys hijacking life online?*_

I can give the answer but you may not like it, so for now. I'll leave that question unanswered.
