# Daemon
Contentious and yet Valueable tool that severly underratted. 

Normally I lurk on twitter on most days just to stay on topic when it comes to infosec or hacking apart from traditional newsletters I get every now and again. 
And usually I see some debate/slapfight, if you can call it that, which more or less goes like

- "You use a telegram bot, you aren't an actual hacker"
- "You're a ddos script kiddie"
- "Larp that you can't hack out of a paper bag"
- "Fake hackers larp, broke and skid"

and so on and so forward. 

I get it though, the community itself has thrived of ego, flexing and work being shown. Sometimes however, I think the slapfights can be counterproductive 
because its a distraction. So when I normally see it, I try not to pay mind. 

However, it did get me to thinking why are tools so frowned upon. If in the end, it gets an objective being taken care of? 

Especially when bots is concerned. 

_Preface of Automation_

That I remember the use of bots was during my IRC stint. The one I remember most was eggdrop. Eggdrop, the oldest bot within the IRC world and used for channel
management, flood protection, etc. Supported TCL scripting (Tool command language) to expand basic functionality of the bot. 

Then there was blootbot and then those bots that used winnuke, smurg floods and other attacks if 2 crews had beef with each other. 

During those days, I wasn't interested so much in bots as more as trying to do two things. Finding clues about the amanda todd case and understanding how irc worked
It didn't really occur to me that IRC was an old platform I was using until I discovered other platforms like telegram or discord. 

But even then, I do recall that the people weren't so much badagering of why using bots but more of the use. But of course even then, the slapfights debate happened
even then. 

And to be honest, I didn't think I would really get myself involved in bots or coding them. That is until later on I would discover Discord and Telegram. 

_Diametric - Discord and Telegram_

The easiest way to describe Discord and Telegram that they are diametric in terms of hacker culture and privacy: one is mainstream and public, the other 
is semi-underground and mid secure. However both do allow you to code bots. 

In terms of API. Discord is both powerful and indepth, which grants you more deeper control over roles, channels and events within servers. Discord bots use 
websockets which makes a bot react in real time, has interactivity (i.e bot goes into voice chats). Which in hacker ethos, control is absoultely a must. 
Telegram on the other hand its the opposite in terms of simplicity. Simple without any complex comands of setting roles or multi purpose. More message and UI 
focused. Telegram bots also rely on polling or webhooks, very limited selective choices of what you can do. But telegram serve a purpose in bots that thrive
on commands. 

In terms of hosting. Both allow you to self-host your bots however telegram also hosts your bot if you use its default botmaker 'BotFather'. Botfather is user 
friendly to create your own bots. Both also have good libaries and some oath2 support. Discord however beats in the ecosystem and full support of oath2 

In their uses, Discord offers what I like to call the overall learning experience if you want to dip your toes into coding with its vast ecosystem and code a 
whole roladex of bots for its uses. While telegram allows you to specialize. Which is why specialized bots like ddos bots or c2 thrive on telegram. This is why 
you also see malware as a service or web stresser businessness on telegram alot.

Security and Privacy? Depends. Discord bots are more of internal server security and operate in a sandbox method and there's no database to search discord bots. 
Telegram on the other hand, security is very broad. You can search the bot publicly and use it without joining a chat. It also can have access to groups or chats 
they are added to. which for privacy that can be a problem since it can expose private telegram groups to some vulnerablity. 

_The trinity comparison?_

The question would be if discord and telegram can ever be compared to IRC? Its tough because if it weren't for IRC then messenging chats or platforms that we have
now wouldn't exist if it weren't for IRC. This is a fact to be honest. That said, the only comparison could be their use plus intergration and security.

But when its all said and done, you can look at it as this. 

Discord = Mainstream 
Telegram = Specialization 
IRC = Foundation 

All 3 are meant to be studied and learned from. As my street mentor who I will name E (god rest his soul) told me when I was 14. 

*"Never and I mean ever disregard anything because the thing you can consider insignificant now will bite you in the ass later."*
