## Duality

_Protecting others isn't necessarily black and white._

The biggest rebellion story ever told in the history of humanity. Lucifer wanted to have his own rein of the kingdon before being expelled. Thus created the duality mindset, right or wrong, true or false, heaven or hell.

Now why this example?

Simple, which bracket of the human population is prone to rebellion and outright questioning of the world around them?

Teenagers

Huh? you must've thought

Yes. and now who could they be rebelling against?

Obviously parents would be the logical answer. However, it isn't just them. 

Its also the people who try to look out for their best interest against the dangers of the world. Whether they are in their lives or not.

<ins>**A request**</ins>

"Can you look at this instagram page? Please tell me that you see the same thing as I do and how dangerous this is."

I can't remember exactly what happened before the question gets asked however, I always am briefed about whatever new topic is going on in the world. I told the user who reached out to me that I would. 

and I did. 

The instagram page I looked at was of the name of a woman with the picture with some shitty bio and seemingly the image that she tried to portray was of a "bad bitch" yet white trash. Yet as I scrolled down the profile, I saw that the videos were not of the woman who from the profile picture. But rather the of a teenager. I ended up finding out later that the child was the woman's own daughter.

Those videos ranged from her suggestive dances and outright performances that would make any parent to try and shut that shit down if it were their kid doing it. But that was not the surprising part. 

As I looked in the comments, there were users that were saying the following
"you're so pretty"
"dm me"
"please post more"
"are your dms open"

When I clicked on the profile of these comments, I saw that these people leaving comments were grown ass men. Men who knew that the girl had to not been older than 13 or 14 years old. But yet this was not the surprising part.

The daughter would post voice recordings and dms that she had with older guys on the profile where she engaged, yet this was not the surprising part. 

The surprising part for me was that in one of the videos that she posted in her mothers account was her being in the shower from the neck upward and steam surrounding her, lip-syncing a song. That video ended up with **509 views** and 3 comments, from grown ass men. 

The girl in that video was quite literally producing content out on her own free will for seemingly sick people and nobody ever questioning it. The mother for what it seems did not do her job in telling her daughter to stop. The worst part of it was that the daughter posted that type of content on her mother's account for a better part of the year.

<ins> Child safety is beyond the predator </ins> 

Whether being a predator hunter, authorites or anons who work on opchildsafety. Its very easy to have some duality in thought. Always the thought to be about stopping the predator since children and teenagers up to 18 years old do not have the mental capacity to understand and are vulnerable .

But that's just it, the predator only goes as far as long as they find a pick that they can go on and not all targets are ignorant. In the case of this girl that I'm telling you about. She knew what she was doing and was not a shame about any of it. But it is also how she opened herself to being a target for them. 

Why? because the rebellion and bashful comes from emotion and a predator can decipher it. Vulnerability isn't just about a moment of depression or rage, the big picture of things, vulnerablity comes from unregulation of emotions.

Something that as a parent, it becomes easy to forget. However, its necessary as you as an adult, you were a teenager yourself and know what its like. A child however, has no reference to go back to and in this is what the predator knows as well. 

<ins> Tic for Tac </ins>

As I realized the activity of the girl in her mother's instagram profile, it became clear that I had a hard task ahead of me. So I went ahead and planned to unmask the men who were commenting on the girls videos. Which would be on the following day.

I spoke to the person who introduced me to the instagram page and sort of guided them to report this to proper channels and if they knew a mandated reporter, to also sent it to them and report it. 

The following day, I started to go through every single like, comment, profile and went and got all that I needed to get from such users

DOB, Name, Address, numbers, relatives, cars, businesses 

Everything you can think of a private life, I obtained it, even in countries where public information is tough to obtain. But you can always count on people lowering their guard to the screen to make the job easy for you. 

Out of the 26 targets I found that were suspect in nature. Only 16 were confirmed to being adult men that were exhibiting pedo behavior to this girl. 

Many of those users were outside of america with only 3 americans. South Africa, India among other countries. 

Some single, some with families and kids of their own.

It repluse me to no end. 

So after finishing the unmasking and sending tips to the agenices to their respective countries. I then went to NCMEC and send the instagram profile but not just that one. 

Apart from unmasking the alleged pedos, I also did a check on the girl and her mother and found that there were many duplicate accounts the daughter created, many of the same content but little views. Those accounts were reported as well to NCMEC. 

I later got confirmation that a mandated reporter was reached out to and were handled out the evidence and it was turned over the police. 

<ins> Epilogue </ins>

_"The Internet is the ultimate distribution system for child pornography," says Robert Flores, a former attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division, Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (Kaplan, 1997)"_ - Armagh, D. (n.d.). A Safety Net for the Internet: Protecting Our Children. A safety net for the internet: Protecting our children. https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh176/files/jjjournal/jjjournal1598/net.html 

I ended up finding out later that a video was made of the discovery and the work that was done for which concluded in those profiles being gone. Which I'm glad it was. It was a case that concluded itself. One of the few instances in my life where I felt purposeful in a road where uncertainty exists if you go after unsavory people. 

Child safety after all isn't just about going after the predator in question, its also about protecting potential victims from themselves in being the target. so that the rebellion story that I explained in the beginning doesn't repeat itself over and over again. Maybe a hope to the future is for this crime not inflict in the futher generations to come.

Now I know the question will be asked, are you back to hunting pedos? 

I don't think I ever stopped in terms of hunting unsavory people. Big picture of things, I simply now only observe and act accordingly if needed to.

Take Care,<br>
