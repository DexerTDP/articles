_Being in the deception business is not what's cracked up to be._ 

_"In July 2015, a group of anonymous internet sleuths called The Impact Team hacked Ashley Madison’s website — stealing user account data for its 37 million users and threatening to post it online. The data stolen included users’ login details, email addresses, payment transaction history and passwords. The Impact Team threatened to release all customer records (including sexual fantasies, credit card information and real names and addresses) online unless Avid Life Media — Ashley Madison’s parent company — shut down all of its websites, per Business Insider."_ - Eidell, L.

Who would've thought right? 

Hackers hacking a cheating site. Kind of lulzy. A private life be opened due to the carelessness of the thrill. Much like cheaters tv of real life but without leaving the comfort of your room. 

This year 2025 marks the decade of such hack.

Could it happen again? Contrary to what experts can tell you, one can never be too sure. 

Now you must be thinking, "ha ha ha like you had anything to do with the ashley madison hack, you're full of shit"

Whoever said I actually was apart of it? I never was.

But then again who told you that the Ashley Madison hack was the only scenario of when cheaters and hackers mixed?

<ins>Between Black and Grey</ins>

I insinuated in my interview with mark from soft white underbelly that I dealt with cheaters at the time I was active. This all started due to an idea that was talked about with my group members in December 2014. 

At that time I was already so worn out with the operations we were doing in dos RP/pedo sites, doxing and reporting cappers to NCMEC portal, as well as trying to piece the Amanda Todd case. In the little free time I had in between college classes, I dealt with imagery that mentally twists your perception of humanity. On top of it, the feeling of heaviness knowing that you have other people with you who are doing this work without any idea how the same work could be affecting them.

That particular day, nobody wanted to start the work, soul wise, we were starting to freeze mentally and emotionally from doing anything. Today it would be called, being numb. So to break the ice, we start to talk about what was happening outside of what we were doing, to get us on the mood to at least do something.

Until one member started to talk about one his relatives' friends who was having a dilemma with his gf. Apparently, dude wanted out as he found a new bitch and cheating on his official gf with the new side. Everybody including me were like cheering for the guy because fuck it. So I suggested to see what we can help the dude with.

The member didn't believe what he was hearing out of me and questioned me twice to confirmed. I remember replying to him 

"Listen its either we do this before our mind breaks."

Seriously that's how it began, that guy was client zero. 

Now you maybe asking why help cheaters, isn't that a bit immoral in breaking up relationships or families even? I mean look at it this way. Both were operations, each with their theme and tasks. The dark being opchildsafety - Amanda's case one day and the next, helping idiots who chose poorly but want an out; which was the light.  

Looking back, a mind did break while doing this side business. In this case, mine did.

<ins>Setting the foundation</ins>

I won't go into detail of how we set it all up step by step because after all it wasn't just me who was doing this endeavor. However what I can tell you that the first job, it was decided that the member would ask a relative of his to be the bridge between their friend and us to try to gather as much information as we can on this situation. 

And boy he vented a lot, to the point that we were able to understand, what was the situation, who were all the parties involved, etc. There was no need to do any OSINT, CSINT or send a bait (phishing or Metasploit payload) to get more info. However, he was forewarned that if he wanted to stay hidden and then out the relationship to start anew, it would come at a price.

He agreed to pay. We gave him the amount, he ended up paying it before we started anything. While we were waiting for payment, we were working on our other investigations. By the payment came in February 2015, we were all stoked that we were going to branch out a little bit. 

By the time we brainstormed on what we would do. It was decided that we would give alibi to our client while systemically create fake profile to entice the target; cause them to pull the trigger to cheat with the fake profile. That way the target would become the cheater while our client, free of taking accountability and leave with reputation intact. 

Deception? yes. 

Now a days it would be called "loyalty test". 

Except the difference between that and what we did, our prerequisite for us to take your case would've been you had to be cheating already and wanting an out. 

No exceptions.

And to make matters interesting is this was done without help of AI, we did our due diligence in doing a psychological profile on the target and had material ready to work with and covered every aspect in the book if suspicion arose. 

It turns out, the woman fell for the cheating hook, she also was cheating with some other dude prior. The dude was just glad it was over. All of us in my group looked at all that and laughed. Like if this is love then what the fuck is the fuss all about?

<ins>Peeling an Onion</ins>

I think around finishing up the 1st case in helping a cheater around mid march, I was more or less also going through therapy at this time in a student health center in my university. I went there to deal not only with my past trauma but also to help me cope with what I was doing online with the business and operations. 

Every single one of the members gathered up to see if we wanted to do more cases of cheaters and if so, how we would approach to it? Of course by this time, the relative of the member wanted to know a little bit more of what we were doing. I let the member explain briefly who they were and their affiliation with me. They were ok about it but wanted an in to the group. 

Long story short, they were a friend of the group but not a member. The perk they got was a small percentage of pay of what we get and they would get me as a reference for any job application as they were looking for work anywhere. 

As far as the members and I went, we thought, well how can we expand ourselves to help other dumb idiots. Then we narrowed it down to one site where anonymity was some what still present.

_"..It was approved by a landslide in the Senate earlier this week, as NPR's Alina Selyukh has reported, but has been met with criticism by free speech advocates and sex workers. As Craigslist wrote, the law seeks "to subject websites to criminal and civil liability when third parties (users) misuse online personals unlawfully."_-Kennedy, M. (2018, March 23). Craigslist shuts down personals section after Congress passes bill on trafficking. NPR. https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/23/596460672/craigslist-shuts-down-personals-section-after-congress-passes-bill-on-trafficking

You can say what you want about craigslist, sure it had its issues. For one, I was glad the personals was down since the personals section, it was no man's land. Where love, deception and just shit of all ranges met. Ironically enough, it was where we as the group decided to post an ad to grow the business and we were located within the Los Angeles County. Given the population of 10 million in 2015, why not do it there?

The first ad that was posted was very vague with keywords that entice people who wanted to vent out to submit anything, that we were there to listen. We figured people lower their guard to a screen. But holy shit. People really let out what they were holding in. We would take turns of reading whatever was submitted as all of us had access to the email. Protocol had to be established to keep things in order.

Some stuff that was written had to be filtered. Some was nonsense, some was understandably tragic, some was just, no...but once a submission came in where it was relating to cheating on someone. We usually follow up with said submitter via the friend of the group, who was more social out of all of us.

Then the blueprint was started all over again. The difference now is that we didn't know the client and they didn't know us, in techie language this would be similar to a "least privilege" business model. By the end of the contract, we accepted tips. Only one asshole didn't pay for which, he had consequences. But the rest left a tip and some paid decently. The money ended up being allocated and the group's cut was to cover costs in a Eastern European bulletproof VPS that was used for our other operations. 

You know the phrase that people say "I'm not like anybody else you ever met?"

Well that went out the window when this was done. Some people just like the thrill of sticking it in a hole or receiving the stick inside of them as they were wet.

What? did you think we only had men as clients? Women love sex just as much as guys did, the only difference is, they add emotion to the cheating. 

And almost all of the cheaters that I dealt with had one thing in common, they wanted to be intact of their sin because they had more to lose and didn't want to be seen as "the bad guy." I mean, just leave em but I guess the rift between reputation and pleasure is a thin slope. If money can buy people, it also can also buy emotional manipulation.

<ins>Internal glitch</ins>

I was doing this for about 4 to 5 months by now when the Ashley Madison hack occurred. All of us in the group laughed. Like how in the fuck you people were caught slippin? 

But ironically, it only helped us because we got more cheating stories out of it. One or two that we follow-up on claimed to be one of the ones who used the site. We never asked to confirm because the nature of the business was, you know what the client wanted to reveal. And while we could've confirmed by other means but we didn't want to pass that threshold of "what if", we ended up not taking them as clients due to their own potential exposure.

In between some days focusing on going after truly vile people and other days helping out dumb idiots. It was an ok middle that I on a personal level was comfortable with. But then it happened. I started to see people differently, especially if it was couples. I would sit anywhere and just pay attention. Analyze people surrounding me.

Some of the questions I would ask were:
- What were you hiding?
- Where you actually happy or full of shit?
- Do they know? 
- Is your darkest secret harming people?

The questions began to be overwhelming in my mind and decided to refuge in my own vices, in order to stop thinking about those questions. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. Sometimes, the flashbacks of the other operations did not help either in keeping me focused. And while I was going to therapy, then because I wasn't fully open, it didn't work fully as it only helped to study people better.

But then, I met someone I was interested in. 

Now I was confronted with a dilemma, can I trust this person I wanted to be with? Apart from all the shit I had seen, the reasons people would do their actions and all. I tell you, I was becoming miserable as shit. The fact that I couldn't disclose the internal war that I was going through because I didn't want to feel like a burden. It only complicated matters. 

And while I can't speak for the rest of the former members of my group but I gather they trying to best to hang on as well.

Until it wasn't possible.

<ins>Set it free</ins>

So what caused me to end it all?

One case felt wrong and it was unlid. That's what it took. By this point, I was not able to form the relationship with the person I met as they didn't have the patience to deal with a fuck up like me with baggage. 

I won't get into inner specifics of details of what happened in the case but know that the end of it caused me to break the rule of going beyond the curtain and leak what we had to the unsuspecting target. This client in particular had a DV charge on them and potentially was trying to trade the old for the new so to speak. However, the target instead of I guess being thankful, she was mad and blamed us for the problems in her relationship with the client to the point she wanted to unmask us by any means. 

Also a whole lot of stuff was going on at this time with all of us in the group; that at times I felt genuinely we were all losing our damn minds due to the stress of our operations. Plus the possibility of the bitch reaching out to whoever and having orders for our arrest was there. So as tough as it was, I had decision to make and as that song goes from the doors

_'This is the end, My only friend, the end'_

Now you know what caused me to retire from hacking in August 2016.

<ins>Afterword</ins>

As I sit here and type this, it feels weird. Hell, doing the interview with soft white underbelly was weird. Mainly because its not in my nature to disclose. Keep it lock and die with it is what many prefer to do and I was that way for many years. And while on many of what I've done I withhold for legal reasons. But when it comes to this pellicular subject. After years of holding the memories in, it takes a toll. It isn't the same, coming in with one mind and leaving with a completely different take on love, relationships and just dealing with people.

I was utterly conflicted, understood people even less and dealing with cold rage that therapy didn't help much in understanding. 

For the people who have called me a criminal and evil over the years for the shit I did. My answer to you is this, who were my victims exactly? Because in none of them that I had in cases except for those who were victims of crime were entirely "innocent".

Nevertheless, I'm lying in the bed I made years ago. Dealing with memories and thoughts of my actions. Currently, I'm reliving the last case that's affecting someone near me somewhat. Despite being  retired but even then, I'm conflicted because as much as you try to be there for someone, ultimately only they can take action.

So what's the point in writing this?

I only look for understanding, not redemption as I don't feel like I deserve it and along the way enlighten people to maybe take things slow in relationships. Because at the end of day, you truly don't know anybody in this world. And while the digital tools are advancing to make finding love tricky given how advanced ai is. The only thing you can do is be patient, time does the rest.
