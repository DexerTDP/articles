_When fame was the reason a crime became mainstream to talk about._

**Disclaimer - Before beginning this article, I would like to preface that the person and case I am going to write about has been investigated by both law enforcement and went to court for which they were found not guilty. This article will look at the overall view of the case from a very detached perspective to keep the integrity of all sides of the coin in mind.** 

_"Dan Reed’s world-rocking 2019 documentary detailed the experiences of survivors Wade Robson and James Safechuck – perhaps too definitively for this sequel to have anything new to say. If only it had waited for their trial"_ -Seale, J. (2025, March 18). Leaving Neverland 2: Surviving Michael Jackson review – the shocking exposé of the megastar is a hard act to follow. The Guardian. https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/18/leaving-neverland-2-surviving-michael-jackson-review-dan-reed

I remember when back when the original documentary of leaving neverland was aired around 2019. It was heavily pushed by the media as a "expose". Quite ironic after it came out, it had more holes than I possibly realized. I also remember that around this time, my group members and I decided to write a post where all of us were dissecting the film when we had our netwire blog. From the "rolex ring" claim, the lack of a criminal investigation but rather go civil to other inconsistencies that showed a one dimensional perspective. We also talked about how tech we had now, if it had existed then, would've had changed the investigation? 

And while at that time, we felt privately that the documentary would hurt more of the victims of CSA and organizations that supports survivors of CSA, who may have been support them, when all along it could've been a cash grab. Now that I heard this sequel and watched it. From my lens, the second was not necessary. 

However,

It did bring up the memories of me growing up hearing about Michael's allegations as a kid. In fact, its all I can remember growing up before discovering his music. One thing is an undeniable fact. Had he not been accused of the crime, the overall crime itself would have never gone mainstream and thus never been talked about in mass. 

<ins>*The Slow Build of Chaos*</ins>

I don't think people now really understand when the allegations came out in the summer of 1993, how deep and shocking all of it was when it came to Michael Jackson. The man then had the world in the palm of his hand. While being sensationalized as the product of his fame and slow dehumanization, it only earned him more supporters by the overwhelming public who adored him.  If you were to talk to some of his supporters, they would say that the dehumanization campaign started around 1985 when he bought The Beatles catalog. And, it may have been the tipping point. However, he was warned about buying the catalog beforehand.

"Jackson did a full turn, jumped in the air and shrieked. “But wait,” Branca warned. “Other people are also after the catalogue. It’s going to be a struggle.” Jackson replied, “I don’t care. I want it . . . please.” -Hilburn, R. (1985, September 22). THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD - Los Angeles Times. Los Angeles Times. https://www.latimes.com/la-me-jacksontimeline-catalog-story.html

Regardless in how people want to look at it, his growing fame was becoming a double edged sword. On one hand you get an adoring public mesmerized by you and on the other you get those who wish to exploit the creative. Celebrity is nothing more than a toxic cycle of exploitation that the only way to escape is to have power. and if you don't align with those in power to stay on top then you become exploited yourself. And in the case of Michael, his actions and decisions after achieving the pinnacle of success may have put him in the fence that till this day people still debate whether he was one or not.

_"... If a man could say nothing against a character but what he can prove, history could not be written. Animals strike not from malice, but because they want to live. It is the same with those who criticize, they desire our blood, not our pain. But still I must achieve, I must seek truth in all things. I must endure for the power I was sent forth, for the world...But have mercy, for I've been bleeding a long time now."_ -Michael Jackson -The Pain being Michael - UPI Archives. (1987, October 5, Letter sent originally to People Weekly). UPI. https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/10/05/THE-PAIN-OF-BEING-MICHAEL/9713560404800/

<ins> _And we are off_ </ins>

By the time the allegations in 1993 happened. It was a whiplash. Every single channel in the world cover the seasonalized scandal. Its no secret that the media had a field day, after all the media is a business. Michael in his personal life was never truly a normal guy, shit would you be if all you knew was work from a young age on stage to benefit others? 

However, his behavior and everything about the guy was just a magnet for those who outside of the music business did not have his best interest in mind. Where it was a ticking time bomb of when he would be hit with the very thing he cared the most and made him to be the monster. 

Predator to be exact.

Ironically enough, if you go through this era and how the media reacted to such, many people were having shows about the topic and the question that was always asked 

_Did Jackson did it?_

People all of a sudden had a face and a profile of what a rich predator looked like that was weird enough to parade to the media.  From the tabloid show Hard Copy to talk shows like Gerado would host topics of the such. To books and interviews coming out which ranges from people's testimony (real or coerce) to a book written by Victor Gutierrez showing how other sick fucks were viewing Jackson as one of their own to push the narrative of "normalization". The later which Michael did sue the author for defamation and won for obvious reasons.

Nevertheless, it lead to people wanting to know more about the topic. 

In fact, an obscure documentary came out in the eve of the aftermath of the scandal with his own general study. This documentary has been said its used by the FBI to train its agents and profilers to have an understanding of the crime.

".._Though the documentary features copious interviews with disapproving early-90s gay-rights types (“We’re not with them,” lisps one neatly coiffed dude at a March on Washington that NAMBLA joined), some gay film festivals wouldn’t touch it. Instead, it premiered at the first New York Underground Film Festival in 1994 and made national headlines. Don’t forget, k*** s** was a hot topic then, what with the recent scandals of Michael Jackson, Katie Beers, and Polly Klaas clogging news time...."_ - Halter, E. (2003, November 30).

<ins> *An act of service that predicted future irony* </ins>

On July 8, 1994, a college project documentary film called Chickenhawk: Men who love boys was released in select film festivals, theaters and home theatre. The film was created and produced by Adi Sideman then NYU student who then would become later on founded and was CEO of YouNow, a streaming platform. In the film according to imdb sees the study of members of NAMBLA and what they are. Some called a shock of a film, others call it an act of service that this topic was given a broader scope. To me, I call it a film that highlighted a future unseen irony.

How so?

Well remember when I said that Adi Sideman founding YouNow? The site which years later was a platform that was frequent by the very people he profiled in the film. A problem that I also witness myself when I worked in what happened to Amanda Todd.

"An app that's gaining popularity is causing concern among police and child safety advocates because it encourages young people to livestream their every move to strangers. Experts worry that predators will use this app, called YouNow, to prey on children. YouNow is available to anyone and within minutes of downloading it, KMBC 9 News found it showing a number of teenage girls singing in their bedrooms or eating a snack after school. KMBC didn't even need to get the users to accept a friend request to gain access to the images." - Henry, K. (2017, October 5). Experts: Popular livestreaming app could draw sexual predators. KMBC. https://www.kmbc.com/article/experts-popular-livestreaming-app-could-draw-sexual-predators/3687687

I'm sure adi was well aware of the problem of his platform but much like the issue with tech companies moderating content. How do you keep up with the ever constant changes that deviants do to stay under the radar. As much as I can argue that more could've been done but also, how can they stay ontop of a growing problem without risking being accused of "censorship"?

<ins>_ Well did he or didn't he?_ </ins>

There's some videos that ask this in the current day when it comes to Michael. You might ask me what my thought is. As Lisa Marie Presley, his ex-wife mentioned before amongst the lines of 'I never saw anything, I would've done something if I had. But the only people who will know of what really happened is whoever was in that room.'

The truth is, Michael was not an easy person to understand. Will I ever say he's a saint? No. Because that would be an insult to him as he wanted to be seen as human. And part of being human is making mistakes. His mistake, trusting people he shouldn't. And while He didn't have an ordinary life but he was not a saint as some of his hardcore fans depict him as.

However.

I do believe Michael was incapable of harming anyone other than himself due to self loathing. As one who has hunted very sick people, from my perspective. If Michael had those tendencies, it would've manifested in some way or another beyond of the words he said, which launched the 2003 case. And while the agencies maybe shit in getting them to open an investigation when it comes to reporting of the crime. But when it comes to them putting the effort to trying to build a case, they are through and will scrape shit out of your ass to find something. And given the FBI file on Jackson and the court papers from the 2005 trial, Jackson had his private life turned upside down. His internet history was also put on blast for people to see as well. Had the technology that we had now been used back then, I can almost say those who at least are in #opchildsafety would've no doubt been interested to see what they found on him apart from investigators.

Looking back at it, his case made me understand multitude of perspectives, from the victim, from the justice system. Quite frankly I do believe that the people who made the allegations should've been looked into to as well to cover all bases. If justice system is fair to deliver justice then it should be measured both sides of the scale and let the verdict fall. 

But wishful thinking after all, the justice system can be blind. But the old saying goes, life has a way to show you the overall picture.

<ins> _Cycle always repeats_ </ins>

After the Jackson allegations were closed, more cases of abuse have come forward in the last 2 decades, from epstein, r.kelly, bryan singer, diddy to name a few just as films and shows go to discuss the crimes and the old topic of "why they did it." and to be honest, I'm not sure if its a good thing or not.

On one end, these are real people that display their genuine suffering to the world as the media try to make money of the victims. But on the other end, some people look at the crime as a launching pad to clout which leads to false allegations. And not just of CSA but also other crimes too. Causing a riptide that washes anybody in thus that's how the true crime phenomena came to be. But when it all goes away at the end of the day, everybody moves on while the people in the center of it all deal with the aftermath. 

Which then begs the question

In covering a crime to the media, who does it actually help?
